# RIYAPOLA Mobile App - Redesign

![](./app/assets/images/readme.png)

Our goal in this project is to improve the Riyapola mobile application which we previously selected as our use case. We intent to add more user-friendly interfaces & functionalities to this particular application in this project. Riyapola is an advertising mobile application which can be used by both sellers and buyers. Sellers can sell their items by posting an advertisement about their items to the app while buyers can search through the items using advanced search option & buy their preferred selling items from the advertisements by contacting the seller.

Current version of this application contains login in, sign up, account management, advertisement management, advance filter & theming functionalities. Even though there are many functionalities most of them not working properly. Even the user validations and email validations not functioning well. There are three navigation bars available in the app and user get confused with the question which one to use.

We are planning to fix these issues and make it more user friendly. In our user research, we are looking for two sorts of users to find out how they feel by using the app. This will also assist us in determining if any more upgrades are required. Alternatively, whether the user has a positive experience with the application

#### NOTE‚ùó: This project is developed just for assignment purposes.
